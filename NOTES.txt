Functionalities:
CREATE/EDIT/DELETE -- done!
COMMENT -- done! Integrated from blog_app.
LIKE -- not capped for users (need to keep track of who liked what).
RETWEET -- done! Works without updating the database.
FOLLOW/UNFOLLOW -- likely won't be implemented for some time 
                    (need to keep track of who followed who, and find some way to display the messages)
